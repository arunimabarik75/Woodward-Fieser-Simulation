# Woodward-Fieser Virtual Lab
This project is a virtual lab for simulating the Woodward-Fieser rules, a set of chemical rules used to determine the structure of organic molecules based on their UV-vis spectra. The application is built using React and Bootstrap.

## Features
1. Simulate UV-vis spectra for various organic functional groups.

2. Predict the structure of an unknown molecule based on its simulated spectrum.

3. Learn about the Woodward-Fieser rules through interactive tutorials.

## Technologies Used
1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

2. Bootstrap: A CSS framework for responsive web design.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
   
   `git clone https://github.com/arunimabarik75/Woodward-Fieser-Simulation.git`

2. Install dependencies
   
   `cd Woodward-Fieser-Simulation`
  
   `npm install`

3. Start the development server
   
   `npm start`

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
